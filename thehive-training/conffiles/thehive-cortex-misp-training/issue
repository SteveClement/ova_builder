TheHive -> http://\4{eth0}:9000
Cortex  -> http://\4{eth0}:9001
MISP    -> http://\4{eth0}

On VirtualBox port-forwarding from your host to the guest is in place:

TheHive -> http://localhost:9000
Cortex  -> http://localhost:9001
MISP    -> http://localhost:8080

If this fails, make sure the host machine is not occupying one of the forwarded ports or a firewall is active.
